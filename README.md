On choosing a topic, the main screen will disappear and the question screen will become visible.

Your score counter is at the top of the screen and the question is below it.

The options are in the form of buttons and not a check box group ( just doing something different here ).

There is a message telling you if your answer is right if you choose the right answer and you score is increased. Whereas if you choose the wrong answer then there is no message displayed and the score is not increased.

After all the questions have been answered, the question screen disappears and the result is displayed along with the option to retry the quizz or return to the main screen.
